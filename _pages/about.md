I am an Assistant Professor with the ECSE Department of [Case Western Reserve University (CWRU)](https://case.edu/){:target="_blank"}. Before that, I was an Applied Scientist at Amazon AGI, where I contributed to enhancing the video understanding capabilities of [Amazon Nova](https://aws.amazon.com/ai/generative-ai/nova/?gclid=Cj0KCQiAhbi8BhDIARIsAJLOlucsx9KxXwToIdKG7pYLuge9e1ADvtlsc_rqnu5IP4B1sm5dgj2UOGIaAplmEALw_wcB&trk=36201f68-a9b0-45cc-849b-8ab260660e1c&sc_channel=ps&ef_id=Cj0KCQiAhbi8BhDIARIsAJLOlucsx9KxXwToIdKG7pYLuge9e1ADvtlsc_rqnu5IP4B1sm5dgj2UOGIaAplmEALw_wcB:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!692006004844!e!!g!!amazon%20nova!21048268689!159639953895){:target="_blank"}, a next-generation foundation model. I have obtained my PhD degree from the [Ming Hsieh Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE)](https://minghsiehece.usc.edu/){:target="_blank"} at [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/){:target="_blank"} in 2023. I was advised by [Prof. Peter A. Beerel](https://sites.usc.edu/eessc/people/){:target="_blank"}. My research interests include energy and latency efficient algorithm-hardware co-design for machine learning at the edge. 

During my PhD tenure, I was fortunate to be a recipient of the USC Viterbi School of Engineering's highest achievement award, [The 2024 William Ballhaus Best PhD Dissertation Award](https://minghsiehece.usc.edu/2024/05/gourav-datta-wins-ballhaus-prize-for-best-phd-dissertation-at-hooding-ceremony/){:target="_blank"}, the [IEEE Graduate Fellowship on Applied Superconductivity 2022](https://ieeecsc.org/awards/ieee-csc-graduate-study-fellowship-applied-superconductivity){:target="_blank"}, the [best Research Assistant (RA) award from USC ECE](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MFgrPcU0LMQdcmaT7tOWssGwcgk_BC9o){:target="_blank"}, and the Annenberg fellowship. I was also a finalist of the [Qualcomm Innovation fellowship 2022 (North America)](https://www.qualcomm.com/research/university-relations/innovation-fellowship/finalists){:target="_blank"}, a [Ming Hsieh Ph.D. scholar](https://minghsiehece.usc.edu/mhi-home/mhi-mhi-scholars/){:target="_blank"}, and a DAC 2021 PhD fellow. I have published more than 45 peer-reviewed papers in top-tier venues including Nature Scientific Reports, Frontiers in Neuroscience, ICLR, ECCV, TCAS-I, DATE, WACV, among others, and received a best paper award nomination at VLSI-SoC 2022. Lastly, my research on in-sensor computing have been highlighted multiple times [here](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6968231572244152320/) and [here](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6907836062614597633) by Edge Impulse, a leading semiconductor IP company for TinyML, and USC Viterbi School of Engineering [here](https://viterbischool.usc.edu/news/2023/03/smarter-cameras-a-new-vision-for-the-future/).



Prior to joining USC, I attended [IIT Kharagpur](https://www.iitkgp.ac.in/){:target="_blank"} where I obtained my B.Tech. degree in [Instrumentation Engineering](https://erp.iitkgp.ac.in/ERPWebServices/curricula/CurriculaSubjectsList.jsp?stuType=UG&splCode=IE){:target="_blank"} with a minor in [Electronics and Communication Engineering](http://www.ecdept.iitkgp.ac.in/){:target="_blank"} in 2018. I was adjudged the academically best outgoing student in my programme at IIT Kharagpur.

In my spare time, I like learning Mathematical Analysis, Modern Finance, Economics and Philosophy. I also like playing and watching soccer, and driving along the Pacific highway.
