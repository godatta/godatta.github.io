I am an Applied Scientist at Amazon AGI. I have obtained my PhD degree from the [Ming Hsieh Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE)](https://minghsiehece.usc.edu/){:target="_blank"} at [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/){:target="_blank"} in 2023. I was advised by [Prof. Peter A. Beerel](https://sites.usc.edu/eessc/people/){:target="_blank"}. My research interests include energy and latency efficient algorithm-hardware co-design for machine learning at the edge. 

During my PhD tenure, I was fortunate to be a finalist of the [Qualcomm Innovation fellowship 2022 (North America)](https://www.qualcomm.com/research/university-relations/innovation-fellowship/finalists){:target="_blank"}, a [Ming Hsieh Ph.D. scholar](https://minghsiehece.usc.edu/mhi-home/mhi-mhi-scholars/){:target="_blank"}, and a DAC 2021 PhD fellow. I was a recipient of the [IEEE Graduate Fellowship on Applied Superconductivity 2022](https://ieeecsc.org/awards/ieee-csc-graduate-study-fellowship-applied-superconductivity){:target="_blank"}, the [best Research Assistant (RA) award from USC ECE](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MFgrPcU0LMQdcmaT7tOWssGwcgk_BC9o){:target="_blank"}, and the Annenberg fellowship. I have published more than 25 peer-reviewed papers in top-tier venues including Nature Scientific Reports, Frontiers in Neuroscience, ECCV, TCAS-I, DATE, WACV, among others, and I have received a best paper award nomination at VLSI-SoC 2022. Lastly, my research on in-sensor computing have been highlighted multiple times [here](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6968231572244152320/) and [here](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6907836062614597633) by Edge Impulse, a leading semiconductor IP company for TinyML, and USC Viterbi School of Engineering [here](https://viterbischool.usc.edu/news/2023/03/smarter-cameras-a-new-vision-for-the-future/).



Prior to joining USC, I attended [IIT Kharagpur](https://www.iitkgp.ac.in/){:target="_blank"} where I obtained my B.Tech. degree in [Instrumentation Engineering](https://erp.iitkgp.ac.in/ERPWebServices/curricula/CurriculaSubjectsList.jsp?stuType=UG&splCode=IE){:target="_blank"} with a minor in [Electronics and Communication Engineering](http://www.ecdept.iitkgp.ac.in/){:target="_blank"} in 2018. I was adjudged the academically best outgoing student in my programme at IIT Kharagpur.

In my spare time, I like learning Mathematical Analysis, Modern Finance, Economics and Philosophy. I also like playing and watching soccer, and driving along the Pacific highway.
